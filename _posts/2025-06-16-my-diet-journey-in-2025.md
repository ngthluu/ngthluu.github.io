Last year, I set a challenge for myself: to reach 65kg and complete a full marathon (FM).  
I ran a lot, followed a strict diet, and went from 86kg to 72kg. It was a dream come true. I could finally wear clothes that hadn’t fit me before 😎.

But around Christmas, I faced some mental struggles and lost my focus. I gained weight and stopped working out 😢.  

Okay, enough with the excuses.  

Today is June 17, 2025.  
My current weight is about 79kg 🐖.  
**This year, I will reach 65kg.**  
So, what's my plan?  

I think last year's strategies worked well, so I’ll stick with them.
Here’s my plan:
1. **Workout**:
I’ll run 6km a day—as often as possible. Since it’s the rainy season in Ho Chi Minh City, I’ll aim for 3–4 runs per week. On the other days, I’ll do weight training (with my 5kg dumbbells at home) and calisthenics (in the park where I usually run).
2. **Diet**:
To lose about 1kg per week, I’ll keep my intake around 1,500 kcal per day. No sugar, no fast food—just pure water and three proper meals a day. No snacking.

**Last year, I lost around 3kg per month. So if I stay on track, I should reach 65kg in about 5 months — around November this year.**

Below is my daily tracking. I’ll update the progress every weekend, and my weight will be recorded on Sundays.
1. 18/06/2025: Run 6,02km (1:00:58). Cheated 3-4 small snacks.
2. 19/06/2025: Run 6,04km (52:42). Cheated 3-4 small snacks & 1 coconut milk coffee.
3. 20/06/2025: Run 6,00km (57:39). Followed diet.
4. 21/06/2025: Rest day. Followed diet.
5. 22/06/2025 (Sun) **78kg**: Play badminton. Followed diet.
