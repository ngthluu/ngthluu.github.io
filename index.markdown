Life is short.  
But it's a memorable journey — truly worth walking to the end.  
In the end, our best friend — Death — will come.  
His visit is inevitable.  
In that moment, what truly matters isn't fame, money, or even love.  
It's what we've done — both good and bad.  
We come into this world as nothing, and we leave the same.  
That’s the beauty of life.  
In the end, God is fair.

Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.  
My name is Luu. *Luu* means *to keep* or *to stay*.  
I come from a small, poor mountain town in Vietnam.  
I'm a software engineer, and I enjoy researching culture, history, and religion.  

This is my personal blog.  
I hope you find something interesting here.
